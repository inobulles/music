# Music player

This is the default music player for AQUA.

Super WIP, nothing is actually implemented currently!

## Building

This requires [Bob the Builder](https://github.com/inobulles/bob):

```sh
bob build
```

Note that, at the moment, all paths are hardcoded to my local paths.
In the future, these will point to the respective directories in the [AQUA monorepo](https://github.com/inobulles/aqua).

## Running

Simply:

```sh
bob run
```
